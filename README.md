# What this app does

Aims to replicate the mobile LIFX application as a webapp.

If you use LIFX Lights and would like to try this out, I'll eventually host it on my [page](https://joon.dev).

[How to get your key](https://api.developer.lifx.com/reference/how-to-use-the-following-examples)

## Current Features

1. List active lights
2. Turn listed lights on and off

## Coming Up

1. Slider to adjust brightness more precisely (like the app)
2. Colour wheel selector

## Long Term Plans

I want to essentially copy what the lifx mobile app can do. However there are a couple blockers such as the lack of a backend at the moment to perform routines.

## Tools Used

This is a front end only app at the moment written using:

- TypeScript React
- some HTML and CSS

In the future I may extend this into a full stack app using:

- Go, Python, Node, or some other backend language
